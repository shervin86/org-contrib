This repository contains add-ons to Org.

You can use them by installing the =org-contrib= NonGNU ELPA package
from https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/.

** Please help maintaining these add-ons

Files in this repository used to live in the Org repository but have
been filtered out of the Org 9.5 release.  The =contrib/= directory used
to contain a =scripts/= directory that now lives on [[https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/src/master/code][the Worg repository]].

*Files in this repository receive little if no maintainance and there
is no guaranty that they are compatible with the Org stable version.*

For files a =Maintainer= header and a =Homepage= pointing outside of this
repository are in transition: they are maintained and will be removed
from the next release of this repository.  As a user, please carefully
track the new URL where the add-on is now maintained.

If you want to maintain some of these add-ons, please send me an email
at =bzg@gnu.org= once you set up a separate repository for them.

** Files to remove from the next release

[This patched version from the Emacsmirror actually already removes
these files.]
